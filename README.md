# COMBSS-VIGNETTE

Here we provide a comprehensible detailed vignette to run COMBSS algorithm for best subset selection for a linear regression model.

We mainly use here R code. In addition, we show how to use the python version of COMBSS from R.

The python version is currenlty faster than the R version for COMBSS and it is recommended to use it for high dimensional context.

We illustrate the inference of the semi-Markov model on two real datasets: Stanford Heart Transplant data and asthma control data.

This vignette reproduces some replications from the simulation study presented in our article :

COMBSS: Best Subset Selection via Continuous Optimization. Sarat Moka, Benoit Liquet, Houying Zhu, and Samuel Muller.
