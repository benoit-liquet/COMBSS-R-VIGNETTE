# COMBSS-VIGNETTE

Here we provide a first vignette to run the COMBSS algorithm for best subset selection for a linear regression model.

We mainly use R code here. In addition, we show how to use the python version of COMBSS from R.


This vignette reproduces some replications from the simulation study presented in our article :

> Moka S, Liquet B, Zhu H, and Muller S (2022). COMBSS: Best Subset Selection via Continuous Optimization. *Submitted to arXiv*, 36 pages.


## Getting Started

In this short vignette we used the following R packages

```
library(cPCG)
library(fields)
library(mvtnorm)
```
