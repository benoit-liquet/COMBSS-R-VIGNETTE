# COMBSS-VIGNETTE

Here we provide a first vignette to run COMBSS algorithm for best subset selection for a linear regression model.

We mainly use here R code. In addition, we show how to use the python version of COMBSS from R.


This vignette reproduces some replications from the simulation study presented in our article :

COMBSS: Best Subset Selection via Continuous Optimization. Sarat Moka, Benoit Liquet, Houying Zhu, and Samuel Muller.'


## Getting Started

In this short vignette we used the following R packages

```
library(cPCG)
library(fields)
library(mvtnorm)
```


##  COMBSS in a low dimensional data context

- This analysis is presented [here](/Low_dimensional_example.md)
 

## COMBSS in a high dimensional data context

- This analysis is presented [here](/High_dimensional_example.md)
